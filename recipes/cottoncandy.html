    <h4>Soft yet sticky delicious cotton candy</h4>
    <p>Hardly anything brings us back to our childhoods more than cotton candy. There’s just something awe-inspiring
        about this seemingly physics-defying candy made from sugar and air.<br>
        Plus, it has such a distinct flavor, cotton candy worked its way into a whole host of other treats and drinks,
        from ice cream to cocktails.</p><br>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the sugar, corn syrup, water, and salt in a large heavy-bottomed pot, then stir over medium-high heat
