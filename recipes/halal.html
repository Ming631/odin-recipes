            Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Season the marinade to taste with kosher salt and black pepper.
            Place the chicken in a 1-gallon zipper-lock bag and add half of the marinade (reserve the remaining marinade
            in
            the refrigerator).</li>
        <li>Turn the chicken to coat, seal the bag, and marinate the chicken in the refrigerator
            for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the bag and pat it dry with paper towels.
            Season with kosher salt and pepper, going heavy on the pepper.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a 12-inch heavy-bottomed cast iron or stainless-steel skillet
            over medium-high heat until it is lightly smoking</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces and cook without disturbing until
            they are lightly browned on the first side, about 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the chicken is cooked through</li>
        <li>Using a chef’s knife, roughly chop the chicken into 1/2- to 1/4-inch chunks.
            Transfer to a medium bowl, add the remaining marinade</li>

        <li>Add the turmeric and cumin and cook until fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute</li>

            about 4 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
            Raise the heat to high and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Cover, reduce to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes without disturbing</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and allow to rest until the water is completely absorbed and the rice is tender,
            about 15 minutes</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>For the Sauce:</h4>
